# Worklog — append, never rewrite

Every agent session that touches this repo adds an entry at the top:
date · agent · what changed · what was left alone · anything unpushed.

## 2026-08-14 · Claude (Cowork)
- Seeded this worklog and AGENTS.md after a week of uncoordinated edits.
- State at time of writing: HEAD = 739b433 (Open the Door hero, desktop).
  Pending on disk: reconciled page.tsx (mobile hero fix), new
  hero-open-door-m.webp (crops past the soft-focus F), brand.ts reverted,
  hero-open-door-2*.webp parked in _candidates/ — all landing via Shelby
  running "Reconcile Hero.command".
- Known history worth knowing: 14 Aug, an unidentified agent half-switched
  HERO to -2 files (brand.ts edited, page.tsx not) while the tree held a
  stale page.tsx importing the deleted `notes` export — build was broken
  until reconciled. 12 Aug, a different agent rewrote the desk app's Etsy
  stub into a full OAuth integration (good code, reviewed) without any
  record here. Neither event was discoverable except by diffing.
- Deploys: Vercel auto-deploy from main is healthy (~60s push to live).
- Do NOT touch: protected campaign language, the wordmark construction,
  charitable wording, anything in AGENTS.md's "never invent" list.

## Earlier (reconstructed, incomplete)
